# Sticky-Notes
Sticky Notes, done in express with a local database in MongoDB, has user authentication with encryption and uses Bootstrap for a good part of the styling.

Instructions:
1) create a .env file in the root of the folder, add a variable named SECRET=ENCRYPTION-CODE, and replace the encryption code part with your unique line of characters that will encrypt the passwords.
2) run npm install
3) install MongoDB on your PC, or switch out the connection URL with a MongoDB Cloud Atlas string.
4) run node app.js
5) open in localhost:3000
